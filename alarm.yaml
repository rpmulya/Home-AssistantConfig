#passcode_attempts: 3 #[Optional] Disabled if commented out. When a value equal or greater than 0 is set, the system will only allow the set amount of password attempts before timing out
#passcode_attempts_timeout: 30 #[Optional] Default 30 seconds. When set with the password attempts option the panel will timeout for the amount of seconds set if the password is entered incorrectly as per the password_attempts option. The system will then reset the allowed password attempts


clock: True  #Optional - True enables a clock in the center of the status bar
perimeter_mode: True #Optional - True enables perimeter mode, this could be known as 'Day Mode' i.e. only arm the doors whilst there is someone using all floors
weather: True #Optional - Allows a weather summary to be displayed on the status bar. Dark Sky weather component must be enabled with the name sensor.dark_sky_summary

############# SENSOR GROUPS ########################
# Sensors in this group tigger the alarm immediately
immediate:
  - binary_sensor.pintu_utama
  - binary_sensor.pintu_dapur
  - binary_sensor.pintu_ruang_makan
  - binary_sensor.ruang_makan
  - binary_sensor.ruang_tamu
  - binary_sensor.ruang_cuci
  - binary_sensor.dapur
  - binary_sensor.garasi

# Sensors in this group start the clock (pending_time) when tripped before the alarm is activated in 'Away' mode
delayed:
  - binary_sensor.teras

# Same as notathome but hopefully the title is more self explanatory. Can still use notathome for backwards compatibility
# Note sensors can exist in more than one group notice top_floor appears in two groups
homemodeignore:
  - binary_sensor.ruang_tamu
  - binary_sensor.pintu_ruang_makan
# Use this group to automatically override the warning message on open sensors when setting 'away' mode. (I use this as I have a motion sensor at the front door)
#override:
#  - binary_sensor.pintu_utama

# This group is special and only effects 'perimeter mode'. If perimeter_mode is enabled then any sensor in this group will trigger the alarm immediately if arm perimeter is set. There is no delayed group for this mode (unless requested as a feature of course!)
perimeter:
  - binary_sensor.pintu_utama
  - binary_sensor.pintu_dapur
